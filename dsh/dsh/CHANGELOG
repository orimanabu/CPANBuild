v2.0.1 Jan 14 2002 mtp
fixed my email address on the manpage
(hey, noone sent me a message telling me it was wrong :-P)

installation bug fixes

v2.0.0 Aug 01 2001 mtp

added parallel execution of the command 
(now dsh is a lot faster) 

added a configuration script
(makes dsh installation a lot easier and makes dsh more portable)

wrote a manpage from scratch
(includes the many new features of version 2.0 and there are lots of examples--
 I like examples)

added verification of the status of the nodes before execution of the command
(hey, sometimes nodes go down, and it's helpful to be notified of this before
you try to run a command on these nodes)

based the removal of duplicate nodes on IP addresses instead of hostnames
(different hostnames can refer to the same IP address)
 
added standard error to the node output
(I sure like to be notified of errors :-) )

fixed the quoting of shell metacharacters
(an important fix, see the -e switch in the manpage)

fixed the formatting of the output when the names of nodes are different lengths
(easier on the eyes)

implemented fanout
(not everyone has front end computers with tons of resources, see FANOUT in
 the manpage)
