Operating System: Solaris 8, running on Sun Blade 1000 processors
Software: Perl 5.005_03, dsh 2.0.3, Term-ReadLine-Gnu 1.10, GNU
Realine library 4.2

If I wanted to use the Term-ReadLine-Gnu Perl module, I needed to
first install the GNU Readline library.

When installing the GNU Readline library, ./configure did not find the
location of ar, so I had to edit the Makefile and change the line that
said "AR =" to "AR = /usr/ccs/bin/ar"
